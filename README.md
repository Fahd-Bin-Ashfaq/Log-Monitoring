# 📁 Real-Time Folder Monitor using Python

This project is a real-time folder monitoring tool built with Python. It uses the `watchdog` library to track file system changes such as creation, deletion, modification, and movement within a specified directory. Events are logged with timestamps in a `folder_logs.txt` file, and desktop notifications are displayed using `plyer`.
